        <h1>MY WEB DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY</h1>
       <img src="Laptop image.jpg" width="500"></img>
   </p>
       <p>It was not easy when I started to learn coding, because I was new to it and had no knowlegde about it.
        But I was not discourage by that, I made an effort to learn it by asking for help from my coursemates and some of my friends who were very good at it.
        I was also very determined in learning and never gave up, although I am still not really good, I can see alot of progress in my coding journey.
        All this was also due to the effort of my Web Development lecturer, Mr. Danso who introduced me to FreecodeCamp which also helped me alot.
        Now I can code in Html and style in CSS, and I know if I continue to put in alot of effort, I can become a Full Stack Developer and also start creating amazing websites.
        <h2>How It Started</h2>
